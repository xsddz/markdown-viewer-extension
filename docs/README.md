## What is Markdown Viewer?

Markdown Viewer is a powerful browser extension and multi-platform tool that transforms your Markdown documents into beautifully formatted Word documents with a single click.

You love writing in Markdown — clean, efficient, version control friendly. But eventually, you always need a Word document.

**The old nightmare:**

😫 Manual screenshot flowcharts · Copy-paste formulas become messy · Format code by hand · Adjust tables cell by cell · Spend another 30 minutes tweaking fonts, spacing, and colors after export

**One document: 1 hour writing, 2 hours formatting.**
